Dog Watch

Eventually a watch for dogs, but for now get temperature, acceleration, and angular 
velocity from an ICM42688 sensor (polling & trigger mode).

Description
***********

This application can either poll periodically or setup a data ready trigger 
(interrupt driven) to retrieve sensor data from the ICM42688.

The two options can be configured by setting either of the following two options
in the `prj.conf`:
* `CONFIG_APP_SENSOR_MODE_INTERRUPT``: for interrupt driven sensor data reading
* `CONFIG_APP_SENSOR_MODE_POLLING``: for polling based sensor data reading.

`CONFIG_APP_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS` is not yet wired into the application, so 
it does nothing.
